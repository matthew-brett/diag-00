Results/observations for group00
Christine Tseng, Zuzanna Balewski

We developed two outlier detection methods (see README.md), which produced
slightly different results. While individually the strategies may not be ideal,
we believe volumes identified by both more likely to be true outliers (or at
least less dependent on possible biases in our methods).

It would be very time consuming and expensive to reject scans with any
outlier volumes, so we suggest excluding scans with more than 2
(non-consecutive) outlier volumes.

For group00 data, our outlier detection identifies the following volumes:
group00_sub02_run1.nii 1, 2, 3, 158
group00_sub02_run2.nii 35
group00_sub05_run1.nii 20, 21, 22, 23
group00_sub06_run1.nii 1, 2
group00_sub06_run2.nii 22, 23
group00_sub08_run1.nii 50
group00_sub08_run2.nii 105, 106, 108, 156, 157, 158

Using our rejection criterion, the following scans should be excluded:

-- group00_sub02_run1.nii: The outlier volumes fall near the beginning
and end of the 160TR run. Since run2 for sub02 is not problematic, maybe the
participant did not understand that she should remain still during the
entire run (not just when performing the task). (It is also possible
that the poor data quality is due to an error when the scanner starts and
stops recording?)

-- group00_sub05_run1.nii: The four outlier volumes are clustered together, so
it's likely that the participant shifted and returned to her original position
(vs. moving constantly for the 8 sec span).

-- group00_sub08_run2.nii: The outlier volumes are scattered in the second half
of the scan. The participant could have gotten sleepy or fidgety and stopped
paying attention to the task.

Independently of these outlier computations, we have two observations from
visually inspecting these scans (scripts/vis_4d_movie.py):

-- The top and bottom (sagittal plane) portions of the brain are cut off in
some scans. This is most striking for sub02 and sub03, and noticeable in
varying degrees for other participants. These scans do not necessarily need to
be excluded, but possible inferences both within and between participants
will be limited.

-- Both scans for sub03 have a large dark area in the right temporal lobe.
This could be the result of real asymmetry in the brain (benign/congenital or
lesion) or a scanning artifact. A high resolution anatomical scan would help
resolve this issue. In either case, it may be difficult to generalize any
findings from this participant.
